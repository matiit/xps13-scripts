# XPS 13 scripts

A few useful workarounds for recurring issues I got on xps 13 9300

 - restartaudio.sh booting after using windows, sometimes the sound is not working, however disabling windows' fastboot seemed to resolve this issue permanently
 - touchpad-naturalscrolling.sh XFCE4 seems to lack this option in its interface, it's present and it's working on "bigger" desktop environments like gnome and kde though
 - dual-monitor-scaling.sh simple script to setup second monitor (1080p) with 0.5 scaling - allowing to keep the internal 4k display with no scaling (but with higher DPI) and 1080p monitor still looking readable
